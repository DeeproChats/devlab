🚀 Getting Started with DevLab

This repository contains a complete Docker-based development environment designed for reproducibility across operating systems.
Follow these instructions to set it up on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

🧰 Prerequisites

Before opening or running the environment, ensure the following tools are installed:

1. Docker

Windows / macOS: Install Docker Desktop

Linux: Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose plugin via your package manager

sudo apt install docker docker-compose

2. Dlib model

download from : https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models


Verify installation:

docker --version
docker compose version

2. Visual Studio Code

Download and install from https://code.visualstudio.com

3. Dev Containers Extension

Install the official VS Code extension:

ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers


or directly from the Extensions view:

Extensions → Search “Dev Containers” → Install

🧱 Option 1 — Run via VS Code (Recommended)

This gives you a fully integrated environment inside VS Code.

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/DeeproChats/devlab.git
cd devlab


Open in VS Code

When prompted, click
“Reopen in Container”

VS Code will:

Build the Docker image defined in Dockerfile

Start the container using .devcontainer/devcontainer.json

Mount the workspace inside the container

Once the container is running, your terminal and editor are now inside the DevLab environment.

🧩 Option 2 — Run directly with Docker Compose

If you prefer working outside VS Code:

Build the image:

docker compose build


Start the environment:

docker compose up


To rebuild automatically if changes occur:

docker compose up --build


Run in background (detached mode):

docker compose up -d


Stop and remove containers:

docker compose down

⚙️ Notes

Make sure Docker is running before opening in VS Code.

.env files and local data caches are ignored via .gitignore.

The environment is platform-agnostic: the same configuration runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

🧠 Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors:

Check Docker is running (docker ps)

Run VS Code as Administrator (Windows) or ensure your user is in the docker group (Linux)

Rebuild the container:

Dev Containers: Rebuild Container


from the VS Code Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P)

Would you like me to tailor a short intro paragraph at the top (e.g., “DevLab — a modular AI/ML environment for research and testing”)? That would make the README look more polished when others visit your repo.

Here’s a more direct and developer-friendly version of your README instructions for DevLab setup:

🧠 DevLab — Development Environment Setup

This repository contains a ready-to-use Docker-based development environment for running isolated projects with full VS Code Dev Container support.

🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DeeproChats/devlab.git
cd devlab

2. Build and start the container

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. Then run:

docker compose build
docker compose up


This builds the container and starts the environment automatically.

💻 VS Code Setup

If you're using Visual Studio Code, install the following:

Dev Containers extension (ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

Docker extension (optional, for easier container management)

Once installed, VS Code will automatically detect the .devcontainer folder and prompt:

“Reopen in Container?”

Click Yes.
That’s it — you’re inside the isolated DevLab environment.

🍏 macOS / Linux / Windows Support

Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (WSL2 recommended for Windows users).

Make sure Docker Desktop is running before executing docker compose up.

No additional setup required on macOS — VS Code + Docker + Dev Containers is enough.
